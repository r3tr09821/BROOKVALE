                <h2>Mysterious figure dressed as a clown</h2>
                <p class="summary">Locals have reported sightings of a mysterious figure dressed as a clown. While some insist it has nothing to do with the already well-known clown in town, whispers have started to spread about an old attraction — one that existed before "the incident." No one seems to have real evidence, just a few scattered sweets found on the streets.</p>
                <p>
The police claim the candies were likely dropped by a group of kids on Halloween night. Still, the rumors persist. Over time, the story has become something of an urban legend — a tale meant to scare children and keep them from wandering outside after dark.

Those who say they’ve seen him describe a cheerful clown, always holding a balloon. Anyone who gets close supposedly receives a lollipop... but no one can explain how or why. There are no solid clues, just stories — and not a single piece of real proof that he exists.
